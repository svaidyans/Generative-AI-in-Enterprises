# Azure OpenAI (ChatGPT) in Enterprises: infinite possibilities for powering next generation CEP-X
ChatGPT has taken the world by storm with 100 million users and 1.8 billion hits on its website, within 3 months of launch.  While it can write poetry, help students in assignments, compose novels and a whole lot of other personal tasks, the ChatGPT can play a very important role in enterprises next generation Customer, Employee, Partner Experiences (CEP-X).

Despite availability of numerous digital products, service is poor. An ideal CEP-X omnichannel platform will provide automated timely responses, self-serve options, 24x7.  With the help of Azure OpenAI, enterprises can achieve better CSAT / NPS, operational efficiencies and achieve Sustainability goals.

One of the key concerns for enterprises is data privacy and data security.  So, I have been developing enterprise solutions with Microsoftâ€™s Azure OpenAI version of ChatGPT.  Further, these solutions are integrated with enterprise knowledge base portals to ensure adequate guardrails to prevent undesired responses.
